# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for Simply Supported Beam
This project presents a comparative study of beam deflection analysis using three methods: an Analytical Solution via direct integration, the Finite Element Method (FEM), and a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The PINN is trained to approximate the solution to the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation for a simply supported beam under uniformly distributed loading. By incorporating the governing differential equation and boundary conditions into the neural network's loss function, the PINN demonstrates strong agreement with both traditional methods, offering a mesh-free, data-efficient alternative for solving boundary value problems in structural mechanics.
